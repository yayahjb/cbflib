   CBFlib 0.9.3.3 adds examples of the description of a multi-module FEL
   detector, thanks to Aaron Brewster of LCLS. New convenience accessor
   functions have been added to expose the details of axes field by field.
   Corrections have been made to the handling of _axis.rotation and
   _axis.rotation_axis. This is an interim release. The API version and
   dictionary will be updated on the next release.

   CBFlib 0.9.3.2 has a revised API version, and, otherwise, the same code as
   CBFlib 0.9.3.1, but with further update to the imgCIF dictionary to avoid
   issues with the PDB validation software. Because of the revised API
   version, many of the data files changed to update the version in the file
   comments.

   CBFlib 0.9.3.1 has the same code as CBFlib 0.9.3, but with an update to
   the imgCIF dictionary reflecting a major technical cleanup by John
   Westbrook. An explanation of the choices of regex versions has been added
   to the README.

   CBFlib 0.9.3 is the formal base release integrating CBF, HDF5 and NeXus.
   It also includes changes to support the description of FEL detectors. More
   details on the integration and the new dctionary including both NeXus
   information and the new FEL detector tags, _axis.rotation_axis and
   _axis.rotation are avialable at https://sites.google.com/site/nexuscbf/.
   The commulative changes in releases 0.9.1, 0.9.2 and 0.9.3 since CBFlib
   0.9.0 are:
     * Temporary removal of default PyCifRW support for compliance with
       Fedora license requirements.
     * Addition of a new tiff2cbf example program.
     * Update pycbf python wraapper for CBFlib.
     * Padding options added to adscimg2cbf by C. Nielsen.
     * System and gnu versions of getopt replaced by cbf_getopt.
     * Code to handle CIF2 bracketed constructs and quoted strings added.
     * System to log errors and warnings added.
     * Java wrapper by Peter Chang added.
     * Dectris template code by E. Eikenberry added.
     * Addition of nibble offset compression trial code.
     * Addition of support for full axis poise calculations.
     * Incorporation of hdf5-1.8.11 and the first phase of code in CBFlib to
       support NeXus, including mincbf2nexus and cbf2nexus by Jonathan Sloan
       of DLS
     * Cleanup and fixes to Makefiles for more reliable builds, and a partial
       preliminary CMakeLists.txt
     * Fixes to support newer DECTRIS minicbf headers in convertminicbf
     * The first phase of code to support

   The changes for FEL support involve major changes to the positioner logic
   used in computing goniometer and detector positions. This code should be
   used with caution.

   Our thanks to Jonathan Sloan, Tobias Richter and Graeme Winter of Diamond
   Light Source and Robert M. Sweet of Brookhaven National Laboratory for
   their major contributions to this release. Without their efforts it would
   not have happened.

   CBFlib 0.9.2.5 in October 2012 through CBFlib 0.9.2.12 in June 2013 were
   an accumulation of minor revisions to the CBFlib 0.0.2.4 release, plus the
   testbed for HDF5/NeXus support and preliminary Eiger support, now released
   in CBFlib 0.9.3.

   CBFlib 0.9.2.4 was a minor revision to the CBFlib 0.9.2.3 release to
   support tiff2cbf for short in tiffs and to fix problems with 64 bit long
   integers uncovered on Mac OSX 10.6 and 10.7 for 64 compilers.

   CBFlib 0.9.2.3 was a minor revision to the CBFlib 0.9.2.2 release to allow
   use of NO_CBF_REGEX to suppress use of regex for convenience in doing
   visual studio builds for cctbx as requested by Ralf Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve
   for cctbx builds.

   CBFlib 0.9.2.2 was a minor revision to the CBFlib 0.9.2.1 release in July
   2011 to update doc/cif_img.dic to the 1.6.4 revision.

   CBFlib 0.9.2.1 was a minor revision to the CBFlib 0.9.2 release in June
   2011 to upgrade the setup script for the pycbf Python bindings to simplify
   using pycbf outside the context of the CBFlib pycbf directory.

   CBFlib 0.9.2 was the recommended release of CBFlib of February 2011.

   CBFlib 0.9.1 included a correction to CBFlib 0.9.0 to make axis the
   cbf_simple routines apply axis rotations correctly for detectors and to
   pick up corrections for byte offet compression incorporated into the
   upcoming CBFlib 0.9.1 release. The earlier version had failed to apply the
   rotations to the accumulated displacements. Our thanks to Joerg Kaercher
   of Bruker-AXS for identifying the rotation problem.

   CBFlib 0.9.0 was a partial pre-release of CBFlib version 0.8 needed to
   support changes in RasMol. This release was incomplete and used were
   advided to use it with caution, but it has proven to be a reliable, stable
   release for 2 years. There have been significant changes in the
   input/output logic and in validation. For a ChangeLog consult the SVN of
   the CBFlib project on sourceforge.

   CBFLIB is a library of ANSI-C functions providing a simple mechanism for
   accessing Crystallographic Binary Files (CBF files) and Image-supporting
   CIF (imgCIF) files. The CBFLIB API is loosely based on the CIFPARSE API
   for mmCIF files. Starting with this release, CBFLIB performs validation
   checks on reading of a CBF. If a dictionary is provided, values will be
   validated against dictionary ranges and enumerations. Tags missing under
   parent-child relationships or category key requirements will be reported.
   CBFlib provides functions to create, read, modify and write CBF binary
   data files and imgCIF ASCII data files.

  Installation

   CBFLIB should be built on a disk with at least 350 megabytes of free
   space, for a full installation with complete tests. Read the instructions
   below carefully, if space is a problem.

   A gizpped tarball of this release is available on sourceforge at

   http://downloads.sf.net/cbflib/CBFlib-0.9.3.3.tar.gz

   In addition,
   http://downloads.sf.net/cbflib/CBFlib_0.9.3.2_Data_Files_Input.tar.gz (13
   MB) is a "gzipped" tar of the input data files needed to test the API,
   http://downloads.sf.net/cbflib/CBFlib_0.9.3.2_Data_Files_Output.tar.gz (34
   MB) is a "gzipped" tar of the output data files needed to test the API,
   and, if space is at a premium,
   http://downloads.sf.net/cbflib/CBFlib_0.9.3.2_Data_Files_Output_Sigs_Only.tar.gz
   (1KB) is a "gzipped" tar of only the MD5 signatures of the output data
   files needed to test the API. Place the CBFlib_0.9.3.2.tar.gz file in the
   directory that is intended to contain up to 4 new directories, named
   CBFlib_0.9.3.2 (the "top-level" directory),
   CBFlib_0.9.3.2_Data_Files_Input and either
   CBFlib_0.9.3.2_Data_Files_Output or
   CBFlib_0.9.3.2_Data_Files_Output_Sigs_Only. If you have wget on your
   machine, you only need to download the source tarball. If you do not have
   wget, you will need to download all the tarballs into the same directory

   Uncompress CBFlib_0.9.3.3.tar.gz with gunzip and unpack it with tar:

      gunzip CBFlib_0.9.3.3.tar.gz
      tar xvf CBFLIB_0.9.3.3.tar

   To run the test programs, you will also need Paul Ellis's sample MAR345
   image, example.mar2300, Chris Nielsen's sample ADSC Quantum 315 image,
   mb_LP_1_001.img, and Eric Eikenberry's SLS sample Pilatus 6m image,
   insulin_pilatus6m, as sample data. In addition there are is a PDB mmCIF
   file, 9ins.cif, and 3 special test files testflatin.cbf,
   testflatpackedin.cbf and testrealin.cbf. All these files will be dowloaded
   and extracted by the Makefile from CBFlib_0.9.3_Data_Files_Input. Do not
   download copies into the top level directory.

   After unpacking the archives, the top-level directory should contain a
   makefile:

                           Makefile   Makefile for unix 

   and the subdirectories:

     src/           CBFLIB source files                                       
     include/       CBFLIB header files                                       
                                                                              
     bin/           Executable example programs                               
     doc/           Documentation                                             
     examples/      Example program source files                              
     html_images/   JPEG images used in rendering the HTML files              
     lib/           Compiled CBFLIB (libcbf.a) and FCBLIB (libfcb.a)          
                  libraries                                                   
     m4/            CBFLIB m4 macro files (used to build .f90 files)          
     mswin/         An MS Windows CodeWarrior project file                    
     pycbf/         Jon Wright's Python bindings                              

   and additional Makefiles for other systems. All the makefiles are created
   from m4/Makefile.m4. Edit the closest approximation to your system, and
   then copy that variant to Makefile.

   In building this release there is an enviroment variable you may need to
   set if you are building on an older machine with a broken dlfnc that
   cannot support the HDF5 filter plugin mechanism:

   HDF5REGISTER

   which should be set to the string "--register manual" to disable the
   automatic plugin search.

   For instructions on compiling and testing the library, go to the top-level
   directory and type:

      make

   Once you have a properly configure Makefile, compile and test the package
   with

      make tests

   or, if space is at a premium, with

      make tests_sigs_only

  regex

   CBFlib makes can optionally use a system regular expression library to
   assist in validation of CIFS. The feature is controlled by two
   compile-time defines. The possible choices are

     * Not to use regex. If CBF_NO_REGEX is defined, no regex will be used.
     * To used the tradition unix regex. If CBF_REGEXLIB_REGEX is defined,
       regex.h is used.
     * To use the newer and more popular POSIX pcre regex. If neither
       CBF_NO_REGEX nor CBF_REGEXLIB_REGEX is defined, pcreposix.h is used.

   The default in the supplied Makefiles is to use regex.h. The default in
   the CMakeLists.txt is to use pcreposix.h.

  Cmake

   A partial preliminary CMakeLists.txt has been included in this kit. It is
   not yet complete, but on machines for which the Makefiles are not
   appropriate, it is worth a try. To use in, create a directory named
   CBFlib-0.9.3.1-build on the same level as CBFlib-0.9.3.1, and in the new,
   empty build directory, try

     cmake ../CBFlib-0.9.3.1
     make all
     make test
    

   Work on improving cmake support will continue, and comments, corrections
   and suggestions would be appreciated.

   Please refer to the manual doc/CBFlib.html for more detailed information.
