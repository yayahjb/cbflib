 * The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for   *
 * information interchange promulgated by the International Union of  *
 * Crystallography (IUCr). CIF (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is the     *
 * recommended method for submitting publications to Acta             *
 * Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal structure       *
 * determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica         *
 * and many other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the    *
 * more general STAR File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches *
 * are used increasingly in the structural sciences for data exchange *
 * and archiving, and are having a significant influence on these     *
 * activities in other fields.                                        *
 *                                                                    *

 * The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data          *
 * interchange standard for science, and its interest in the CIF,     *
 * a conformant derivative of the STAR File, is as a concise data     *
 * exchange and archival standard for crystallography and structural  *
 * science.                                                           *

    /* \brief Look for a dataset with the given properties.

     Succeeds without returning a valid dataset ID if no dataset exists and fails if one with different properties exists.
     Finding that the dataset doesn't exist is not a failure - the function worked and returned useful information.
     So, if it returns \c CBF_SUCCESS then the dataset must be free'd at some point, otherwise it doesn't need to be free'd.

     Use as:
     \code
     int error = cbf_H5Dfind(., &dataset, ...);
     if (CBF_SUCCESS==error) {
     if (cbf_H5Ivalid(dataset)) {
     use_existing_dataset(dataset);
     } else {
     cbf_H5Dcreate(...);
     use_new_datset(dataset);
     }
     } else {
     handle_error(error);
     }
     \endcode

     \param location The hdf5 group/file in which to put the dataset.
     \param dataset A pointer to a HDF5 object identifier that is set to the location of a valid object or an invalid value if the function
     succeeds, otherwise is left in an undefined state.
     \param name The name of the existing/new dataset.
     \param rank See \c cbf_H5Dcreate
     \param dim See \c cbf_H5Dcreate

     Ensure a dataset of the given <code>rank</code> exists and can hold at least as many elements as specified in
    <code>max</code>. If no dataset exists then one will be created with dimensions of [0, 0, ... 0].
     <code>cbf_H5Dfind</code> and <code>cbf_H5Dcreate</code> are used in the implementation of this function.

     An existing dataset may be found using <code>cbf_H5Dfind2(location, dataset, name, rank, max, buf, type)</code>.
     If no dataset can be found then a dataset will be created by setting each element of a buffer of length
     <code>rank</code> to zero and using <code>cbf_H5Dcreate(location, dataset, name, rank, buffer, max, chunk, type)</code>.
     A buffer of <code>rank</code> elements may be provided to avoid using malloc to allocate memory for a small array
     whose size may already be known.

     The value pointed to by <code>dataset</code> should be a valid object identifier if the function exits successfully,
     and will be left in an undefined state otherwise.

     This is roughly equivalent to:

     <code><pre>const int error = cbf_H5Dfind2(location, dataset, name, rank, max, buf, type);
     if (CBF_NOTFOUND==error) {
     int i;
     for (i = 0; i != rank; ++i) buf[i] = 0;
     return cbf_H5Dcreate(location, dataset, name, rank, buf, max, chunk, type);
     } else {
     \/\* 'error' may be 'CBF_SUCCESS' or could indicate an error: \*\/
     return error;
     }</pre></code>

     but contains more sophisticated error handling code and allows for some parameters to be omitted.

     Need to record which tables have been created already, and provide methods to create
     any new tables I need. If a table has been created it will have a node in the CBF
     tree, I can store either this node or NULL to find out if it exists. I always know
     which table I want to create, so can call the appropriate function without needing
     a run-time lookup from a list of creation functions.

     I need a list of table nodes and a list of shared keys to make this work. Like the
     'cbf_nx2cbf_key_t' this can be removed and replaced with function-specific parameters once
     they are known.

    /*
    Process data from a single row of 'diffrn_radiation'.

    Calculate some of the stokes parameters and make reasonable assumptions for those
    which can't be identified with sufficient reliability (ie: intensity, which is not
    present in CBF in a usable form; and circular polarisation, which is not present
    in CBF in any form). Write the data to the appropriate place in nexus.

     If the stokes vector is properly specified then the 2-parameter polarisation
     is ignored.


     Stokes_I:  Ip+In, where where Ip is the intensity
     (amplitude squared) of the electric vector in the
     plane of polarization and In is the intensity
     (amplitude squared) of the electric vector in the
     plane of the normal to the plane of polarization.

     Stokes_Q:  (Ip-In)*cos(2*theta), where where Ip is
     the intensity (amplitude squared) of the electric vector
     in the plane of polarization, In is the intensity
     (amplitude squared) of the electric vector in the plane
     of the normal to the plane of polarization, and theta
     is the angle as viewed from the specimen, between the
     normal to the polarization plane and the laboratory Y
     axis.

     Stokes_U:  (Ip-In)*sin(2*theta), where where Ip is
     the intensity (amplitude squared) of the electric vector
     in the plane of polarization, In is the intensity
     (amplitude squared) of the electric vector in the plane
     of the normal to the plane of polarization, and theta is
     the angle as viewed from the specimen, between the normal
     to the polarization plane and the laboratory Y axis.

     Stokes_V:  +/-2*sqrt(IpIn), with a + sign for right-handed
     circular polarization, where where Ip is the intensity
     (amplitude squared) of the electric vector in the plane of
     polarization and In is the intensity (amplitude squared) of
     the electric vector in the plane of the normal to the plane 
     of polarization, and theta is the angle as viewed from the
     specimen, between the normal to the polarization plane
     and the laboratory Y axis.

     The theta referred to in Stokes_Q and Stokes_U is that same
     as the value of _diffrn_radiation.polarizn_source_norm,
     and depends on the choice of laboratory coordinate systems.
     In particular, that angle may change between the CBF laboratory
     coordinate system and the NeXus McStas coordinate system.  In
     all cases the normal to the polarization plane is assumed to
     be orthogonal to the direction of the beam


     Looking head-on at the beam from sample to source, we have


            \             |  CIF_Y [0,1,0]
             \            |
              \           |    | nx_y (nexus Y axis)
               \          |    |

     In this example, nx_y is at a negative angle. phi, from
     CIF_Y, and the new value of nx_theta with be increased
     by -phi.  
       nx_Stokes_Q = cos(2*phi)*Stokes_Q+sin(2*phi)*Stokes_U
       nx_Stokes_U = cos(2*phi)*Stokes_U-sin(2*phi)*Stohes_Q

                                     enough about the axes in the set to be able to do that here.

                                     - Iff the parent axis is in a set then the dependency is on that set.
                                     - As the dependency may be on an axis, all axes must already be processed.
                                     - As the dependency may be on a set, all sets must have been assigned a path.
                                     - Neglect possible complications caused by one axis being in multiple sets.

    /*
    Parametric conversion of data within a sebset of the rows of a single table.

    Note: This accesses (read-only) global state in the form of a table which gives data about mappings.

    Data is extracted and converted by:
    Direct conversion from a single CBF data item to a single NeXus data item.
    Collecting information from each column within a single matching row, then processing it in some way.
    Collecting information from each matching row within a single table, then processing it in some way.

    In complex cases, this _should_ involve collecting data in a per-row cache,
    then adding it to a per-table cache, then adding it to the higher-level
    'key' object. This is by design, to allow suitable processing to be
    inserted in between each level in order to ensure data integrity and
    perform format conversions and carry out memory management as needed.

    This is done by performing the following operations:
    - Locate the category requested and the mapping data for it. An
    error will occur if either isn't found.
    - Data about the primary keys of the table must be populated, to be used
    when matching rows and iterating through columns.
    - A set of matching rows is extracted from the table.
    - create a table-specific cache object
    - foreach matching row {
    - create a row-specific cache object
    - foreach column {
    either {
    - filter data value
    - store in nexus file
} or {
    - cache value as a key to be used later
} or {
    - cache value in per-row cache object
                    }
                }
    - process row-specific cache object, which may involve writing data
    to the nexus file or storing it in a table-specific cache object.
    - destroy the row-specific cache object
            }
    - process and then destroy the table-specific cache object

    This should be used by:
    - defining a set of primary key columns and telling the program how to get at their values.
    - defining a set of filter functions which may be used when converting data items directly.
    - defining a set of cache objects and functions to populate and process them.
    - gluing everything together with mapping tables in a pre-defined format.

    Future extensions:
    Replace the whole data conversion model/pipeline with a more powerful dRel-based model.
