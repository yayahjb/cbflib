<H3 ALIGN=CENTER> The IUCr Policy<BR>
for the Protection and the Promotion of the STAR File and<br>
CIF Standards for Exchanging and Archiving Electronic Data</H3>
<font color="#000000">
<p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for 
information
interchange promulgated by the International Union of Crystallography
(IUCr). CIF (Hall, Allen &amp; Brown, 1991) is the recommended method for
submitting publications to Acta Crystallographica Section C and reports of
crystal structure determinations to other sections of Acta 
Crystallographica
and many other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the more 
general
STAR File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches are used 
increasingly
in the structural sciences for data exchange and archiving, and are having 
a
significant influence on these activities in other fields.
<p>
<h3>Statement of intent</h3>
<p>
The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data interchange
standard for science, and its interest in the CIF, a conformant derivative
of the STAR File, is as a concise data exchange and archival standard for
crystallography and structural science.
<p>
<h3>Protection of the standards</h3>
<p>
To protect the STAR File and the CIF as standards for interchanging and
archiving electronic data, the IUCr, on behalf of the scientific 
community,
<p>
   * holds the copyrights on the standards themselves,
<p>
   * owns the associated trademarks and service marks, and
<p>
   * holds a patent on the STAR File.
<p>
These intellectual property rights relate solely to the interchange 
formats,
not to the data contained therein, nor to the software used in the
generation, access or manipulation of the data.
<p>
<h3>Promotion of the standards</h3>
<p>
The sole requirement that the IUCr, in its protective role, imposes on
software purporting to process STAR File or CIF data is that the following
conditions be met prior to sale or distribution.
<p>
   * Software claiming to read files written to either the STAR File or 
the
CIF standard must be able to extract the pertinent data from a file
conformant to the STAR File syntax, or the CIF syntax, respectively.
<p>
   * Software claiming to write files in either the STAR File, or the CIF,
standard must produce files that are conformant to the STAR File
syntax, or the CIF syntax, respectively.
<p>
   * Software claiming to read definitions from a specific data dictionary
approved by the IUCr must be able to extract any pertinent definition
which is conformant to the dictionary definition language (DDL)[3]
associated with that dictionary.
<p>
The IUCr, through its Committee on CIF Standards, will assist any 
developer
to verify that software meets these conformance conditions.
<p>
<h3>Glossary of terms</h3>
<p>
[1] CIF:
<p>
is a data file conformant to the file syntax defined at
http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/index.html
<p>
[2] STAR File:
<p>
is a data file conformant to the file syntax defined at
http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/star/index.html
<p>
[3] DDL:
<p>
is a language used in a data dictionary to define data items in terms
of &quot;attributes&quot;. Dictionaries currently approved by the IUCr, 
and the
DDL versions used to construct these dictionaries, are listed at
http://www.iucr.org/iucr-top/cif/spec/ddl/index.html
