  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                Before using this software, please read the
                                  [NOTICE]
       for important disclaimers and the IUCr Policy on the Use of the
  Crystallographic Information File (CIF) and other important information.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

CBFLIB is a library of ANSI-C functions providing a simple mechanism for
accessing Crystallographic Binary Files (CBF files) and Image-supporting CIF
(imgCIF) files. The CBFLIB API is loosely based on the CIFPARSE API for
mmCIF files. Like CIFPARSE, CBFLIB does not perform any semantic integrity
checks and simply provides functions to create, read, modify and write CBF
binary data files and imgCIF ASCII data files.

Installation

CBFLIB should be built on a disk with at least 40 megabytes of free space.
First create the top-level directory (called, say, CBFlib).

In order to work with CBFlib, you need the source code in the form of a
"gzipped" tar, CBFlib.tar.gz. Place this file in the otherwise empty 
CBFlib directory you just created.

Uncompress this file:

     gunzip CBFlib.tar.gz

Unpack it with tar:

     tar xvf CBFlib.tar

To run the test programs, you will also need Paul Ellis's sample MAR345
image, example.mar2300, as sample data. This file can also be found at
http://biosg1.slac.stanford.edu/biosg1-users/ellis/Public/. Place that file
in the top level CBFlib directory.

After unpacking the archive, the top-level directory should contain a
makefile "Makefile" and the subdirectories

         src/          CBFLIB source files
         include/      CBFLIB header files
         examples/     Example program source files
         doc/          Documentation
         lib/          Compiled CBFLIB library
         bin/          Executable example programs
         html_images/  JPEG images used in rendering the HTML files

For instructions on compiling and testing the library, go to the top-level
directory and type:

     make

Please refer to the manual doc/CBFlib.html for more detailed information.
