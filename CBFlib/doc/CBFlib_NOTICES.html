<H3 ALIGN=CENTER> The IUCr Policy<BR>
on<BR>
the Use of the Crystallographic Information File (CIF)</H3>
<font color="#000000">
<P>
The Crystallographic Information File (Hall, Allen & Brown,
1991) is, as of January 1992, the recommended method for
submitting publications to Acta Crystallographica Section C. The
International Union of Crystallography holds the Copyright on
the CIF, and has applied for Patents on the STAR File syntax
which is the basis for the CIF format.
<P>
It is a principal objective of the IUCr to promote the use of
CIF for the exchange and storage of scientific data. The IUCr's
sponsorship of the CIF development was motivated by its
responsibility to its scientific journals, which set the
standards in crystallographic publishing. The IUCr intends that
CIFs will be used increasingly for electronic submission of
manuscripts to these journals in future. The IUCr recognises
that, if the CIF and the STAR File are to be adopted as a means
for universal data exchange, the syntax of these files must be
strictly and uniformly adhered to. Even small deviations from
the syntax would ultimately cause the demise of the universal
file concept. Through its Copyrights and Patents the IUCr has
taken the steps needed to ensure strict conformance with this
syntax.
<P>
The IUCr policy on the use of the CIF and STAR File processes is
as follows:
<hr>
<OL>

<LI>
CIFs and STAR Files may be generated, stored or transmitted,
 without permission or charge, provided their purpose is not
 specifically for profit or commercial gain, and provided that
 the published syntax is strictly adhered to.
<LI> 
Computer software may be developed for use with CIFs or STAR
 files, without permission or charge, provided it is distributed
 in the public domain. This condition also applies to software
 for which a charge is made, provided that its primary function
 is for use with files that satisfy condition 1 and that it is
 distributed as a minor component of a larger package of
 software.
<LI>
Permission will be granted for the use of CIFs and STAR Files
for specific commercial purposes (such as databases or network
exchange processes), and for the distribution of commercial
CIF/STAR software, on written application to the IUCr Executive
Secretary, 2 Abbey Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England. The
 nature, terms and duration of the licences granted will be
determined by the IUCr Executive and Finance Committees.
</OL>
<hr>
<P>In summary, the IUCr wishes to promote the use of the STAR File
concepts as a standard universal data file. It will insist on
strict compliance with the published syntax for all
applications. To assist with this compliance, the IUCr provides
public domain software for checking the logical integrity of a
CIF, and for validating the data name definitions contained
within a CIF. Detailed information on this software, and the
associated dictionaries, may be obtained from the IUCr Office at
5 Abbey Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England.
