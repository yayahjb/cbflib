/**********************************************************************
 *                          The IUCr Policy                           *
 *                                 on                                 *
 *     the Use of the Crystallographic Information File (CIF)         *
 *                                                                    *
 * The Crystallographic Information File (Hall, Allen & Brown,        *
 * 1991) is, as of January 1992, the recommended method for           *
 * submitting publications to Acta Crystallographica Section C. The   *
 * International Union of Crystallography holds the Copyright on      *
 * the CIF, and has applied for Patents on the STAR File syntax       *
 * which is the basis for the CIF format.                             *
 *                                                                    *
 * It is a principal objective of the IUCr to promote the use of      *
 * CIF for the exchange and storage of scientific data. The IUCr's    *
 * sponsorship of the CIF development was motivated by its            *
 * responsibility to its scientific journals, which set the           *
 * standards in crystallographic publishing. The IUCr intends that    *
 * CIFs will be used increasingly for electronic submission of        *
 * manuscripts to these journals in future. The IUCr recognises       *
 * that, if the CIF and the STAR File are to be adopted as a means    *
 * for universal data exchange, the syntax of these files must be     *
 * strictly and uniformly adhered to. Even small deviations from      *
 * the syntax would ultimately cause the demise of the universal      *
 * file concept. Through its Copyrights and Patents the IUCr has      *
 * taken the steps needed to ensure strict conformance with this      *
 * syntax.                                                            *
 *                                                                    *
 * The IUCr policy on the use of the CIF and STAR File processes is   *
 * as follows:                                                        *
 * _________________________________________________________________  *
 *                                                                    *
 *  * 1 CIFs and STAR Files may be generated, stored or transmitted,  *
 *    without permission or charge, provided their purpose is not     *
 *    specifically for profit or commercial gain, and provided that   *
 *    the published syntax is strictly adhered to.                    *
 *  * 2 Computer software may be developed for use with CIFs or STAR  *
 *    files, without permission or charge, provided it is distributed *
 *    in the public domain. This condition also applies to software   *
 *    for which a charge is made, provided that its primary function  *
 *    is for use with files that satisfy condition 1 and that it is   *
 *    distributed as a minor component of a larger package of         *
 *    software.                                                       *
 *  * 3 Permission will be granted for the use of CIFs and STAR Files *
 *    for specific commercial purposes (such as databases or network  *
 *    exchange processes), and for the distribution of commercial     *
 *    CIF/STAR software, on written application to the IUCr Executive *
 *    Secretary, 2 Abbey Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England. The        *
 *    nature, terms and duration of the licences granted will be      *
 *    determined by the IUCr Executive and Finance Committees.        *
 *                                                                    *
 * _________________________________________________________________  *
 *                                                                    *
 * In summary, the IUCr wishes to promote the use of the STAR File    *
 * concepts as a standard universal data file. It will insist on      *
 * strict compliance with the published syntax for all                *
 * applications. To assist with this compliance, the IUCr provides    *
 * public domain software for checking the logical integrity of a     *
 * CIF, and for validating the data name definitions contained        *
 * within a CIF. Detailed information on this software, and the       *
 * associated dictionaries, may be obtained from the IUCr Office at   *
 * 5 Abbey Square, Chester CH1 2HU, England.                          *
